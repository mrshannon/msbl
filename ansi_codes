# BASH library that provides variables for the ANSI escape codes.
#
# To use this library simply source the file:
#
#       $ source ansi_codes
#
# Codes to turn on a feature begin with and underscore while those to disable
# the feature end in an underscore.
#
# Example:
#
#       $ echo "This is ${_BOLD}bold${BOLD_}."
#       $ echo "This is ${_RED}red${RED_}."
#       $ echo "This is ${_BOLD}${_RED}bold and red${RED_}${BOLD_}."
